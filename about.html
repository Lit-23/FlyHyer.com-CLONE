      <h1>Founding Team</h1>
      <article>
        <p class="brief-intro">
          Hyer® Aviation was founded by Max van Doorne and Helder Reis, themselves aircraft pilots with decades of experience in the aviation industry. They recognized that the private charter market is still too complex. Some services, which are usually taken for granted in this sector, are not delivered at the same level as they should be. They built Hyer® to tackle this problem.
